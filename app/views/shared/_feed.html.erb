  <!--
  rails knows to call the micropost partial
  because each element of @feed_items has class='micropost'.
  therefore Rails looks for partial with corresponding name in 
  /views/microposts/_micropost.html.erb
  -->

  <ol class="microposts">
    <%= render @feed_items %>
  </ol>
  <%= will_paginate @feed_items %>
